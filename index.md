## DRAFT: THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY

# Data Scientist 

**Developed by the Digital, Data and Technology Profession in collaboration with the Government Analytical Professions (GES, GORS, GSE, GSR & GSS)**

This document has been put together in consultation with the Data Science community across government. It will be iterated further as the community evolves. It should be noted that the definitions and terminology within the document have been chosen to represent as close to a common definition as possible for the role, skills and capabilities across government. In constructing this common definition we recognise that terminology used here will not always match the terminology used in all departments. 

# About the Role

## The value delivered
* Uses large and varied datasets to tackle complex business problems that often span a range of services or departments
* Applies their technical expertise in a range of coding, statistics and machine learning disciplines to produce innovative approaches
* Works with a range of other professions in a collaborative, agile manner to understand the problem and structure analytical approaches using a wider range of data than is normally used in that business area
* Builds scalable data products that can be used by strategic or operational users and can be further integrated into business systems
* Communicates the value of the data product to stakeholders and convince them of the data science opportunity

## The career promise
You will:
* Improve government services using data and make a meaningful difference to people's lives
* Revolutionise government by solving large, challenging problems using data science approaches
* Build up a strong portfolio of data-intensive projects as a hands-on technical leader
* Demonstrate your technical leadership by coding on a regular (ideally daily) basis, at all levels of seniority
* Gain technical experience working in multidisciplinary, agile teams
* Belong to a high-profile, well-respected cross government data science community

# The Role

This section provides detailed descriptions of the role and role levels. This includes the specific capabilities required at each level to have a successful career as a Data Scientist in government, as well as the typical career paths available. The role levels are intended as a framework to be drawn upon and therefore will change depending on the size and complexity of each department.

		<tr>
			<td>
				<p>Data Scientist</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Data Scientists identify complex business problems whilst leveraging data value. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team with Data Architects, Data Engineers, Analysts and others. They work with policy and operations teams to understand where data science can add value. They support strategic and operational decision making. They source, access, manipulate and engineer data processes with data that typically have characteristics of volume, velocity and/or variety. They build credible statistical models from the data and use best coding practices to generate reproducible work. They may draw on other technical and analytical standards from across government and industry. They adhere to the data science ethics framework. They are open minded and demonstrate strong intellectual curiosity. They have an interdisciplinary focus, using techniques and knowledge from across the scientific spectrum.</p>
				<p>In their role, Data Scientists explore and visualise the data, to present the ‘story’ of the data in a meaningful way to a range of technical and non-technical audiences. They use an evolving range of data analysis tools and techniques, including open source - some of which they learn quickly, as and when required. They continuously seek to expand their range of technical skills in addition to their leadership and communications development and propagate data science skills in other teams; understanding the variety of functional roles relating to data science and how they can be most effectively applied to solve business problems. Data Scientists work in an open, transparent and collaborative manner, sharing good practice and seeking to continuously improve the quality of outputs.

				<p>Seeing the big picture is about having an in-depth understanding and knowledge of how your role fits with and supports organisational objectives and the wider public needs and the national interest. For all staff, it is about focusing your contribution on the activities which will meet Civil Service goals and deliver the greatest value. For leaders, it is about scanning the political context and taking account of wider impacts to develop long term implementation strategies that maximise opportunities to add value to the citizen and support economic, sustainable growth.

			<td>
				<p>Changing and Improving
</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>People who are effective in this area take initiative, are innovative and seek out opportunities to create effective change. For all staff, it’s about learning from what has worked as well as what has not, being open to change and improvement, and working in ‘smarter’, more focused ways. For leaders, this is about creating and encouraging a culture of innovation and allowing people to consider and take informed decisions. Doing this well means continuously seeking out ways to improve policy implementation and build a leaner, more flexible and responsive Civil Service. It also means making use of alternative delivery models including digital and shared service approaches wherever possible.

				<p>Effectiveness in this area means focusing on delivering timely performance with energy and taking responsibility and accountability for quality outcomes. For all staff, it’s about working to agreed goals and activities and dealing with challenges in a responsive and constructive way. For leaders, it is about building a performance culture where staff are given space, authority and support to deliver outcomes. It’s also about keeping a firm focus on priorities and addressing performance issues resolutely, fairly and promptly.
</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>Collaborating and Partnering
</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>People skilled in this area are team players. At all levels, it requires working collaboratively, sharing information appropriately and building supportive, trusting and professional relationships with colleagues and a wide range of people within and outside the Civil Service, whilst having the confidence to challenge assumptions. For senior leaders, it’s about being approachable, delivering business objectives through creating an inclusive environment, welcoming challenge however uncomfortable.
</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>Leading and Communicating
</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>At all levels, effectiveness in this area is about showing our pride and passion for public service, communicating purpose and direction with clarity, integrity, and enthusiasm. It’s about championing difference and external experience, and supporting principles of fairness of opportunity for all. For leaders, it is about being visible, establishing a strong direction and persuasive future vision; managing and engaging with people in a straightforward, truthful, and candid way.
</p>
				</td>

For all staff, it means seeking out and implementing solutions which achieve the best mix of quality, and effectiveness for the least outlay. People who do this well base their decisions on evidenced information and follow agreed processes and policies, challenging these appropriately where they appear to prevent good value for money. For leaders it’s about embedding a culture of value for money within their area/function. They work collaboratively across boundaries to ensure that the Civil Service maximises its strategic outcomes within the resources available.
